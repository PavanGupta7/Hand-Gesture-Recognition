**Hand-Gesture-Recognition**

**Description:**
Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition GitHub repository! This project focuses on utilizing the powerful YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning method to recognize and classify hand gestures in real-time. Hand gesture recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, enabling a wide range of applications, including sign language translation, virtual reality, and robotics.

**Key Features:**
- **YOLO Integration:** The repository provides an implementation of YOLO adapted for detecting and recognizing hand gestures, ensuring high accuracy and real-time performance.
- **Custom Dataset:** We offer a custom dataset containing diverse hand gesture images, meticulously labeled with corresponding gesture classes.
- **Model Training:** A step-by-step guide and scripts for training the YOLO model on the custom dataset are included. Pre-trained weights are also provided for quick experimentation.
- **Inference and Real-Time Recognition:** Users can perform real-time inference on videos or webcam streams to identify hand gestures using the trained model.
- **Data Augmentation:** Augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and translation are employed to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to assess the model's performance thoroughly.
- **Sample Results:** We showcase visualizations of hand gesture recognition on various test scenarios, highlighting the model's accuracy and efficiency.
